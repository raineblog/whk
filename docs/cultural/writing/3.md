### 久别重逢

Eliza introduced herself and waited to hear the name of the other woman. "Monika," the woman breathed, her voice a mere whisper. The name hung in the air for a heartbeat, and Monika seemed rooted to the spot, as if her own identity was a shock. With her heart pounding wildly, Eliza saw Monika’s hands begin to tremble as a lifetime of unspoken questions flashed in her eyes. A lump formed in Eliza’s own throat as the truth settled upon her—it was Monika, found after all these years. Realizing this fragile miracle could not wait, Eliza gently took the woman's arm, her voice urgent, "You must come with me. My grandmother is just around the corner."

They walked the short distance to Lena’s home and rang the doorbell. A profound silence hung in the air, thick with anticipation. Eliza pressed the bell, stepped back, and watched, her own breath catching in her throat as the door creaked open. Time seemed to stand still as Lena’s eyes met Monika’s. In them, she saw not the stranger before her, but the ghost of a girl she once knew—a flicker of disbelief, a slow dawning of memory, and then a wave of pure recognition that washed away the decades. A single tear traced a path down Lena’s cheek. The silk scarf, a simple length of fabric, had proven to be an unbreakable thread of friendship, finally pulling two lives back together across the vastness of time.

**Overwhelmed by a powerful wave of relief, I felt tears of joy well up, blurring their approaching figures.** My grandfather reached me first, his worried face softening as he **pulled me into a hug** that anchored me to safety; I could feel the rough texture of his coat and smell the familiar scent of woodsmoke. **It was in that moment I truly understood what he meant by courage: it wasn't the absence of a pounding heart, but the will to steady a trembling hand and act anyway.**
