### 努力

I spared no effort in preparing for this competition. Not only did I consult various reference materials, but I also polished my article repeatedly to ensure its quality.

During my preparation, I spent several weeks researching the topic, drafting multiple versions, and carefully polishing the final essay. Given my diligent preparations, I sincerely hope to understand the reasons behind the outcome.

### 成长

Growth, like a flower, takes time. As vividly illustrated in the comic, a boy is initially discouraged by his plant's slow progress. Yet, with time and sunshine, he is eventually overjoyed to see it in full blossom.

The contrast reveals a profound truth: true growth requires patience and trust in the process. Just as flowers cannot be forced to blossom overnight, our personal development needs time, consistent effort, and the right conditions. We should nurture ourselves steadily rather than rushing for immediate results, believing that with dedication, our moment to shine will surely come.
